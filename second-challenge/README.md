### Second Challenge

#### Background
Yubria and Tupra also trade wheat. The Tuprans grow wheat and sell it Yubians, who mill it into
flour. However, both nations measure the amount of wheat a little differently. 

- Tuprans sell wheat by the coomb. 
- Yubians buy barrels of wheat. 

Boths barrels and coombs are measures of _volume_, not weight.
The consul's aide provides you with a description of the barrels and coombs:

- 1 coomb is 8,701 imperial cubic inches
- 1 barrel is 7,056 imperial cubic inches

#### Challenge
A wheat dealer from Tupra is filling an order from for 50.25 Yubrian barrels of wheat.
How many coombs is that? Extend your application to convert between barrels and coombs.

Additionally, the consul's aide is concerted about users mixing up measures. Your application 
must prevent invalid conversions (e.g. prevent the conversion of stones to barrels).

#### Details
- Like the previous challenge, you are provided with an enumeration and a class.
- You can modify the class and the enumeration however you want, so long as it conforms
to what the unit tests expect.
