### Third Challenge

#### Background
Yubia and Tupra trade both goods and services. One of the most commonly purchased services is
magic. Yubrian wizards and Tupran sorcerers perform acts of magic for hire. The nature of 
their magic is very different and is measured differently. 

- Yubia's wizards measure magic in _Fantasms_
- Trupa's sorcerers measure magic in _Thaums_

The Draule Empire does not use either metrics. The mages of Draule measure magic in 
_Miraculos_

No easy conversion exists between the systems. There are some scholarly attempts to 
derive empirical formulas based on relative exertion, scope of magical effect, and its 
duration. The nature of these conversions is strange and arcane, as is magic itself.

Most academics accept these definitions within the empire:

- 1 Miraculo is roughly equal to f^2-5*f + 12, where **f** is the number of Fantasms
- 1 Miraculo is about (|(sin t)| + 0.5) * there **t** is the number of Thaums 
 
 
#### Challenge
A traveler from Yubia enters the sorcerers' guild in a Tupran city.  He want hire a sorcerer to 
 perform about about 0.75 Fantasm of magic. How many Thaums of magic is that? 
 Create an object-oriented solution.
